# Project_Fake_Reviews_Detection_SOMTE
—Online consumer reviews significantly influence purchase decisions, but the usefulness of reviews is impeded by
fake reviews that portray distorted quality signals. Developing
automated methods for detecting fake reviews is crucial yet
challenging. This project aims to develop machine learning
models that can distinguish between computer-generated (CG)
fake reviews and authentic human-written reviews (OR). The
models will be trained and evaluated on a dataset of 20,000
fake and 20,000 real reviews covering diverse product categories
and review lengths. Both classical machine learning algorithms
and state-of-the-art deep learning models will be explored. The
project evaluation will focus on standard classification performance metrics like AUC, accuracy, precision and recall. This
project will provide benchmarks and a fake review dataset to
support future academic research and industrial applications in
fake review detection.

I. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Online consumer reviews have revolutionized the way individuals make purchasing decisions, offering valuable insights
into product quality, user experiences, and overall satisfaction.
However, this democratization of opinion comes with its own
set of challenges, chief among them being the proliferation
of fake or deceptive reviews. These fabricated reviews aim
to distort genuine product perceptions, mislead consumers,
and manipulate purchasing behaviors for financial gain. The
presence of fake reviews undermines consumer trust in the
credibility of online reviews. Developing automated methods
for fake review detection is therefore crucial yet challenging.
This project aims to develop machine learning models that
can accurately distinguish between fake deceptive reviewsgenerated by computers and authentic truthful reviews written by real consumers. It will investigate alternative detection approaches beyond existing methods like BERT, explore
the synergy between classical and modern machine learning
algorithms for improved accuracy, establish an evaluation
framework using standard metrics, and provide benchmark
datasets to advance future research in fake review detection.
Successful models can help e-commerce and review hosting
platforms detect and filter out fake reviews, improving the
online shopping experience.
